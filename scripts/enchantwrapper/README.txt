The scripts in this folder are not meant to be modified unless you need to change some functionality.
You may want to change the modid for the JEI tab in EnchantJEI.zs. This can be any string, not just a specific modid.
These scripts come from the "CT-EnchantWrapper" repo, see the repo's README for more details.
